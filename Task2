            <b>Jyotirao Govindrao Phule</b>Jyotirao was an Indian social activist, businessman, anti-caste social reformer and writer from Maharashtra.
             His work extended to many fields, including eradication of untouchability and the caste system and for his efforts in educating women and oppressed caste people.
              He and his wife, Savitribai Phule, were pioneers of women's education in India.
               Phule started his first school for girls in 1848 in Pune at Tatyasaheb Bhide's residence or Bhidewada.
             He, along with his followers, formed the Satyashodhak Samaj (Society of Truth Seekers) to attain equal rights for people from lower castes

          <h3>Early Life</h3>
          <p>
            Jyotirao Phule was born in Poona (Now Pune) in 1827 to a family that belonged to the Mali caste. 
            The Malis traditionally worked as fruit and vegetable growers: in the four-fold varna system of caste hierarchy, they were placed within the Shudras.
             Phule was named after God Jyotiba. He was born on the day of Jyotiba's annual fair. Phule's family, previously named Gorhe, had its origins in the village of Katgun, near the town of Satara.
             Phule's great-grandfather, who had worked there as a chaughula, or low-ranking village official, moved to Khanwadi in Pune district. There, his only son, Shetiba, brought the family into poverty.
             The family, including three sons, moved to Poona seeking employment.The boys were taken under the wing of a florist who taught them the secrets of the trade. 
            Their proficiency in growing and arranging became well known and they adopted the name Phule (flower-man) in place of Gorhe.

          <h3>Academic Life</h3>
          <p>
            In 1848, aged 21, Phule visited a girls' school in Ahmednagar run by Christian missionary Cynthia Farrar.
            It was also in 1848 that he read Thomas Paine's book Rights of Man and developed a keen sense of social justice. 
            He realized that exploited castes and women were at a disadvantage in Indian society, and also that education of these sections was vital to their emancipation.
             To this end and in the same year, Phule first taught reading and writing to his wife, Savitribai, 
             and then the couple started the first indigenously run school for girls in Pune.
             He also taught his sister Sagunabai Kshirsagar (his maternal aunt's daughter) to write Marathi with Savitribai.
             The conservative upper caste society of Pune didn't approve of his work. 
            But many Indians and Europeans helped him generously.
